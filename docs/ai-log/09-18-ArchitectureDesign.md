## Asked
Asked for help writing an architecture write-up (layered architecture pattern) 
and a component sketch diagram for our subsystem, based on Chapter 6 of the textbook.

## Produced
Got a full architecture.md write-up explaining why we chose layered architecture, 
what each layer does (Calendar, Resources, Services, Models, Storage), and why 
it fits our project, plus a plain-text component sketch diagram showing the 
layers stacked with arrows between them.

## Changed or rejected
Kept the overall layered structure and the explanation of what each layer does. 
Changed the component sketch from a single linear stack to show Calendar and Resources as two separate, 
parallel boxes at the top feeding into the shared Services layer below — since 
our project has two distinct features (calendar and resource page) rather than 
one single feature stack. Rejected the FastAPI/PostgreSQL-specific language 
since our stack is plain Java with Docker, not a Python/database setup.
